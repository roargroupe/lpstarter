If you need to quickly get started from a scratch code base that already has everything setup from a file structure perspective
then use this project.

Grunt file is already setup. Feel free to change for your needs but to get `grunt` running install the node moudles.

`npm install`

Then to you have two options for running grunt.

`grunt build`

This does a one off build of the project.

`grunt`

This registered watch as the default task which then runs all the other necessary tasks while developing.

Thats it!
